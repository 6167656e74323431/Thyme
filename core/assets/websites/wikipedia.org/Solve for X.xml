<:h1>Solve for X</:h1>
<:p>Solve for X is a think tank-like event and community engagement project launched by Google to incite collaboration to solve global issues, "X" representing a remedy someone or a team is already pursuing. The project kicked off on February 1, 2012 at a three-day convention at CordeValle Resort in San Martin, California. Solve for X talks were presented to 50 people who collaboratively brainstormed to help those pursuing solutions, hosted by Google executives Eric Schmidt, Astro Teller, and Megan Smith who co-created the project. The conventions are expected to occur "a few times a year". The website inaugurated on February 6, 2012.</:p>
<:p>Solve for X has been likened to TED talks since both projects host seminars by innovators, which can be viewed by others "vicariously" through the projects' respective websites. European director Bruno Giussani stated regarding Google's endeavor: "The world needs more ideas, not fewer and more commitment to sharing them freely and openly so that collectively we can test-run them and turn them into reality ... Google being at the origin of this, obviously technology and engineering will play a big role in Solve For X".</:p>
<:p>Solve for X, co-founded by Smith and Teller --- two leaders at Google X with the support of Eric Schmidt, was initially believed to be linked to the Google X Lab working on new technology such as web-connected appliances, driverless cars, and space elevators, but "eWeek" reported that Google X is wed to undertakings created within the company, not the "moonshot" solutions Solve for X was created to scout for where Solve for X is instead a mechanism to support those outside Google X who are working to pursue these "moonshot" solutions of all kinds.</:p>
