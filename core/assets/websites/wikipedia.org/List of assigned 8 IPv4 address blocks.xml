<:h1>List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks</:h1>
<:p>Some large /8 blocks of IPv4 addresses, the former Class A network blocks, are assigned in whole to single organizations or related groups of organizations, either by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), through the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), or a regional Internet registry.</:p>
<:p>Each /8 block contains 2 = 16,777,216 addresses.</:p>
<:p>As IPv4 address exhaustion has advanced to its final stages, some organizations, such as Stanford University, formerly using 36.0.0.0/8 have returned their allocated blocks (in this case to APNIC) to assist in the delay of the exhaustion date.</:p>
<:p>"See also Reserved IP addresses"</:p>
<:p>The regional Internet registries (RIR) allocate IPs within a particular region of the world.</:p>
<:p>Note that this list may not include current assignments of /8 blocks to all regional or national Internet registries.</:p>
<:p>The original list of IPv4 address blocks can be found in RFC 790 (J. B. Postel, September 1981). In previous versions of the document, (RFC 776 (J. B. Postel, January 1981), RFC 750, (J. B. Postel, 26 September 1978)), network numbers were 8-bit numbers rather than the 32-bit numbers used in IPv4. RFC 790 also added three networks not listed in RFC 776: 42.rrr.rrr.rrr, 43.rrr.rrr.rrr, and 44.rrr.rrr.rrr.</:p>
