<:h1>Rules of the garage</:h1>
<:p>The rules of the garage are a set of eleven rules that attempt to encapsulate the work ethos that Bill Hewlett and David Packard when they founded Hewlett-Packard. Since Hewlett-Packard was one of the earliest success stories of the information technology sector, it also used to more broadly describe the work ethos of Silicon Valley.</:p>
<:p>The Rules were first articulated in 1999 by then HP CEO Carly Fiorina - during her tenure as then HP CEO - and they were later used in a Hewlett-Packard ad campaign. The name was a reference to David Packard's garage in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded the company after graduating from nearby Stanford University in 1935.</:p>
<:p>The eleven rules are:</:p>
<:p>1. Believe you can change the world.</:p>
<:p>2. Work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever.</:p>
<:p>3. Know when to work alone and when to work together.</:p>
<:p>4. Share — tools, ideas. Trust your colleagues.</:p>
<:p>5. No Politics. No bureaucracy. (These are ridiculous in a garage.)</:p>
<:p>6. The customer defines a job well done.</:p>
<:p>7. Radical ideas are not bad ideas.</:p>
<:p>8. Invent different ways of working.</:p>
<:p>9. Make a contribution every day. If it doesn’t contribute, it doesn’t leave the garage.</:p>
<:p>10. Believe that together we can do anything.</:p>
<:p>11. Invent.</:p>
