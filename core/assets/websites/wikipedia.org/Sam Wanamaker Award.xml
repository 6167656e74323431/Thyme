<:h1>Sam Wanamaker Award</:h1>
<:p>The Sam Wanamaker Award or Sam Wanamaker Prize is an award established in 1994 for pioneering work in Shakespearean theatre, usually given to individuals who have worked closely with Shakespeare's Globe or the Royal Shakespeare Company; the award is not specific to artistic contribution, and has frequently been granted to businessmen and academics. It is one of the three British awards for classical theatre, alongside the Ian Charleson Award and The Owle Schreame Awards. It is presented by Shakespeare's Globe and named after Sam Wanamaker, the theatre's founder.</:p>
