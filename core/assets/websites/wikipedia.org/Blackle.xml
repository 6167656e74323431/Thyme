<:h1>Blackle</:h1>
<:p>Blackle is a website powered by Google Custom Search and created by Tony Heap of Heap Media, which aims to save energy by displaying a black background and using grayish-white font color for search results. Blackle claims having saved over 7 MWh of electrical energy as of February 2019, a claim under public dispute. For comparison, the average American household consumes 11 MWh of electrical energy per year. </:p>
<:p>The concept behind Blackle is that computer monitors can be made to use less energy by displaying much darker colors. Blackle is based on a study which tested a variety of CRT and LCD monitors. There is dispute over whether there really are any energy saving effects, especially for users of LCD screens, where there is a constant backlight.</:p>
<:p>This concept was first brought to the attention of Heap Media by a blog post, which estimated that Google could save 750 megawatt hours a year by utilizing it for CRT screens. The homepage of Blackle provides a count of the number of watt hours claimed to have been saved by enabling this concept.</:p>
