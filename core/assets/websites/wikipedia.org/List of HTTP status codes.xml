<:h1>List of HTTP status codes</:h1>
<:p>This is a list of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response status codes. Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. It includes codes from IETF Request for Comments (RFCs), other specifications, and some additional codes used in some common applications of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses. The message phrases shown are typical, but any human-readable alternative may be provided. Unless otherwise stated, the status code is part of the HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 7231).</:p>
<:p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the official registry of HTTP status codes.</:p>
<:p>Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) sometimes uses additional decimal sub-codes for more specific information, however these sub-codes only appear in the response payload and in documentation, not in the place of an actual HTTP status code.</:p>
<:p>All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes (or categories). The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any class or categorization role. There are five values for the first digit:</:p>
<:p>- 1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process</:p>
<:p>- 2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted</:p>
<:p>- 3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request</:p>
<:p>- 4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled</:p>
<:p>- 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request</:p>
<:p>An informational response indicates that the request was received and understood. It is issued on a provisional basis while request processing continues. It alerts the client to wait for a final response. The message consists only of the status line and optional header fields, and is terminated by an empty line. As the HTTP/1.0 standard did not define any 1xx status codes, servers "must not" send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 compliant client except under experimental conditions.</:p>
<:p>- 100 Continue</:p>
<:p>- 101 Switching Protocols</:p>
<:p>- 102 Processing (WebDAV; RFC 2518)</:p>
<:p>- 103 Early Hints (nowikiRFC 8297/nowiki)</:p>
<:p>This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was received, understood and accepted.</:p>
<:p>- 200 OK</:p>
<:p>- 201 Created</:p>
<:p>- 202 Accepted</:p>
<:p>- 203 Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1)</:p>
<:p>- 204 No Content</:p>
<:p>- 205 Reset Content</:p>
<:p>- 206 Partial Content (RFC 7233)</:p>
<:p>- 207 Multi-Status (WebDAV; RFC 4918)</:p>
<:p>- 208 Already Reported (WebDAV; RFC 5842)</:p>
<:p>- 226 IM Used (RFC 3229)</:p>
<:p>This class of status code indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request. Many of these status codes are used in URL redirection.</:p>
<:p>A user agent may carry out the additional action with no user interaction only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent may automatically redirect a request. A user agent should detect and intervene to prevent cyclical redirects.</:p>
<:p>- 300 Multiple Choices</:p>
<:p>- 301 Moved Permanently</:p>
<:p>- 302 Found (Previously "Moved temporarily")</:p>
<:p>- 303 See Other (since HTTP/1.1)</:p>
<:p>- 304 Not Modified (RFC 7232)</:p>
<:p>- 305 Use Proxy (since HTTP/1.1)</:p>
<:p>- 306 Switch Proxy</:p>
<:p>- 307 Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1)</:p>
<:p>- 308 Permanent Redirect (RFC 7538)</:p>
<:p>This class of status code is intended for situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the client. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server "should" include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method. User agents "should" display any included entity to the user.</:p>
<:p>- 400 Bad Request</:p>
<:p>- 401 Unauthorized (RFC 7235)</:p>

<:p>- 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons (RFC 7725)</:p>
<:p>The server failed to fulfill a request.</:p>
<:p>Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which the server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server "should" include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and indicate whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. Likewise, user agents "should" display any included entity to the user. These response codes are applicable to any request method.</:p>
