<:h1>Goojje</:h1>
<:p>Goojje (, ) is a spoof website of Google China, which encourages the real site to stay online and comply with Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China. The site was created after Google executives publicly threatened to shut down the Chinese site following the Operation Aurora cyber attack on Google China, which some computer security experts believe may have come from within China as in the GhostNet cyber spying operation. Google China executives had also publicly condemned the necessity of filtering search results in line with the Golden Shield Project (also known as the Great Firewall of China), which some commentators have stated appears to run counter to Google's mantra, "Don't be evil".</:p>
<:p>Goojje, founded on January 14, 2010 also allows searches to be run, but apparently uses Google and Baidu to do the actual searches. Google has demanded that Goojje stop using its logo, but Goojje refused until 2011.</:p>
<:p>Google in Chinese is (pinyin: ), a transcription without regard to its meaning of "valley song". The Chinese name of "Goojje" can be interpreted as having meaning of "the sister of Google". The "jje" phoneme is from the word for sister, "jie jie (姐姐)", which mirrors how Google's last syllable (歌) sounds like "ge ge (哥哥)" (brother).</:p>
<:p>It is said that Goojje is created by a female who is infatuated with Google. Due to Google's withdrawal from China, she decided to build Goojje in memory of it. The website's propaganda is "Goojje it, loneliness all eliminated"</:p>
<:p>All staff members of Goojje were born in the generation after the 1980s. Goojje appears to be run by just one person, Huang Jiongxuan, a female college student from Guangdong.
