<:h1>GData</:h1>
<:p>GData (Google Data Protocol) provides a simple protocol for reading and writing data on the Internet, designed by Google. GData combines common XML-based syndication formats (Atom and RSS) with a feed-publishing system based on the Atom Publishing Protocol, plus some extensions for handling queries. It relies on XML or JSON as a data format.</:p>
<:p>Google provides GData client libraries for Java, JavaScript, .NET, PHP, Python, and Objective-C.</:p>
<:p>An implementation called libgdata written in C is available under the LGPL license.</:p>
