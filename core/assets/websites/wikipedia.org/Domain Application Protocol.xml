<:h1>Domain Application Protocol</:h1>
<:p>A domain application protocol (DAP) is the set of rules and conventions governing the interactions between participants in a distributed computing application.</:p>
<:p>DAPs sit atop HTTP and narrow HTTPâ€™s broad application protocol to support specific business goals. Services implement DAPs by adding hypermedia links to resource representations. These links highlight other resources with which a consumer can interact to make progress through a business transaction.</:p>
