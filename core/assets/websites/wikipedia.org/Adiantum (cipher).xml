<:h1>Adiantum (cipher)</:h1>
<:p>Adiantum is a cipher construction for disk encryption, which uses the ChaCha and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) ciphers, and Poly1305 cryptographic message authentication code (MAC).</:p>
<:p>It was designed in 2018 by Paul Crowley and Eric Biggers at Google specifically for low-powered mobile devices running Android Go. It's available in the Linux kernel since version 5.0. </:p>
<:p>HPolyC is an earlier variant of Adiantum, which uses a different construction for the Poly1305 hash function.</:p>
<:p>The HBSH construction consists of hash, block cipher, stream cipher, hash.</:p>
