<:p>The title Thane of Cawdor is a title in the Peerage of Scotland.</:p>
<:p>The current 7th Earl of Cawdor, of Clan Campbell of Cawdor, is the 26th Thane of Cawdor.</:p>
<:p>In William Shakespeare's play "Macbeth", this title was given to Macbeth after the previous Thane of Cawdor was captured and executed for treason against King Duncan.</:p>
<:p>The historical King Macbeth fought a Thane of Cawdor who died in battle, but he did not thereby acquire the title himself.</:p>
