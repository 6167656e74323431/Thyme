<:h1>Webhook</:h1>
<:p>A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page, or web application, with custom callbacks. These callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website or application. The term "webhook" was coined by Jeff Lindsay in 2007 from the computer programming term "hook".</:p>
<:p>The format is usually JSON. The request is done as a HTTP POST request. The receiving endpoint can choose to whitelist certain IP addresses from known sources. The webhook can include information about what type of event it is, and a secret or signature to verify the webhook. GitHub and Stripe signs their requests using a HMAC signature included in as HTTP header. Facebook signs their requests using SHA-1. The client can also establish the connection using a TLS client certificate which the endpoint can verify.</:p>
<:p>Webhooks are "user-defined HTTP callbacks". They are usually triggered by some event, such as pushing code to a repository or a comment being posted to a blog. When that event occurs, the source site makes an HTTP request to the URL configured for the webhook. Users can configure them to cause events on one site to invoke behavior on another.</:p>
<:p>Common uses are to trigger builds with continuous integration systems or to notify bug tracking systems. Because webhooks use HTTP, they can be integrated into web services without adding new infrastructure. However, there are also ways to build a message queuing service on top of HTTPâ€”some RESTful examples include IronMQ and RestMS.</:p>
