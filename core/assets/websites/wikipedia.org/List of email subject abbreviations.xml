<:h1>List of email subject abbreviations</:h1>
<:p>This is a list of commonly and uncommonly used abbreviations which are used in the subject of an English-language email header.</:p>
<:p>These prefixes are usually automatically inserted by the email client.</:p>
<:p>- RE: or "Re:" followed by the subject line of a previous message indicates a "reply" to that message. Otherwise it may also stand for "regarding" a certain subject. It is not, though, as one might assume, an abbreviation of "reply" or "regarding", but stands for "re", the Latin ablative of "res", meaning "thing", "circumstance" (loosely "about", "concerning", "regarding"), and is expressly allowed for in the RFC 5322 email standard.</:p>
<:p>- FW: a forwarded message. Also written as "FWD: ", "Fwd: " or "Fw: ". The recipient is informed that the email was originally sent to someone else, and that person has in turn forwarded a copy of the email to him or her.</:p>
<:p>These words are inserted in the middle of or at the end of the subject, usually by the author.</:p>
<:p>- WAS: the subject was changed. Not an abbreviation, but the word "was" (past tense of "be"). Also written as "Was: " and "was: ". It indicates that the subject has changed since the previous email, e.g., "Do you know a good babysitter? (WAS: What should we do this weekend?)". This prevents confusion on the part of the recipient and avoids accusations of threadjacking.</:p>
<:p>- OT: off topic. Used within an email thread to indicate that this particular reply is about a different topic than the rest of the thread, in order to avoid accusations of threadjacking.</:p>
<:p>- EOM – end of message. Also written as "Eom" or "eom". Used at the end of the subject when the entire content of the email is contained in the subject and the body remains empty. This saves the recipient's time because they then do not have to open the message.</:p>
<:p>- WFH – Working from Home. Used in the subject line or body of the email.</:p>
<:p>- 1L – One Liner. Used at the beginning of the subject when the subject of the email is the only text contained in the email. This prefix indicates to the reader that it is not necessary to open the email. E.g., "1L: WFH today"</:p>
<:p>- NONB – Non-business. Used at the beginning of the subject when the subject of the email is not related to business. This prefix indicates to the reader that the email is not about a work related or endorsed topic.</:p>
<:p>The following prefixes are often used in software development:</:p>
<:p>- [ANNOUNCE], [ANN] – announcement. A new version of the software has been released.</:p>
<:p>- [BUG] – bug report. A description of an error in the software.</:p>
<:p>- [PATCH] – software patch. New code is attached to or included in the body of the message.</:p>

Recipients therefore should not be surprised by what appears to be missing content, or that some malware might be involved, or that the email utility of the sender or themselves is misbehaving.

<:p>The email client will typically check for an existing "Re:" when deciding whether or not to add one in front of the subject. However, clients may use different abbreviations if the computer is set up for a non-English language, e.g. "AW:" for German, and this can mean that a conversation between two participants can build up convoluted subject lines like "Re: AW: Re: AW: ..".</:p>
<:p>To avoid this, email clients may have an option to force the use of the standard English abbreviations even when all other features are presented in another language, or to recognize other forms.</:p>
