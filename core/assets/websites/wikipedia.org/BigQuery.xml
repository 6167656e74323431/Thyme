<:h1>BigQuery</:h1>
<:p>BigQuery is a RESTful web service that enables interactive analysis of massive datasets working in conjunction with Google Storage. It is a serverless "Platform as a Service" (PaaS) that may be used complementarily with MapReduce.</:p>
<:p>After a limited testing period in 2010, BigQuery was generally available in November 2011 at the Google Atmosphere conference.</:p>
<:p>In April 2016, European users of the service suffered a 12-hour outage.</:p>
<:p>In May 2016, support was announced for Google Sheets.</:p>
<:p>BigQuery provides external access to the Dremel technology, a scalable, interactive "ad hoc" query system for analysis of read-only nested data. BigQuery requires all requests to be authenticated, supporting a number of Google-proprietary mechanisms as well as OAuth.</:p>
<:p>- Managing data - create and delete tables based on a JSON-encoded schema, import data encoded as CSV or JSON from Google Storage.</:p>
<:p>- Query - the queries are expressed in a standard SQL dialect and the results are returned in JSON with a maximum reply length of approximately 128 MB, or an unlimited size when large query results are enabled.</:p>
<:p>- Integration - BigQuery can be used from Google Apps Script (e.g. as a bound script in Google Docs), or any language that can work with its REST API or client libraries.</:p>
<:p>- Access control - is possible to share datasets with arbitrary individuals, groups, or the world.</:p>
