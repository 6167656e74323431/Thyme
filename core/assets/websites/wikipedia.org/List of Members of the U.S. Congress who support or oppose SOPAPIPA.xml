<:h1>List of Members of the U.S. Congress who support or oppose SOPA/PIPA</:h1>
<:p>The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) are two proposed draft laws that were being considered by the United States Congress. Their stated goals are to increase the ability of U.S. law enforcement to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods, and give the U.S. government and copyright holders additional tools to curb access to "rogue websites dedicated to infringing or counterfeit goods", especially those registered outside the United States.</:p>
<:p>Supporters of the laws argued that they are needed to protect the intellectual property of owners of content. Opponents of the laws argued that they endanger free speech and free expression by harmfully regulating the internet.</:p>
<:p>SOPA is the bill under consideration by the U.S. House of Representatives. PIPA is the related bill under consideration by the U.S. Senate.</:p>
