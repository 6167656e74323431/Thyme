<:h1>Music in the plays of William Shakespeare</:h1>
<:p>Music in the plays of William Shakespeare includes both music incidental to the plot, as song and dance, and also additional supplied both by Shakespeare's own company and subsequent performers. This music is distinct from musical settings of Shakespeare's sonnets by later composers.</:p>
<:p>The following are among the most notable examples of songs in Shakespeare's plays:</:p>
<:p>- "It Was a Lover and His Lass" in "As You Like It" V, 3</:p>
<:p>- "Take, O Take Those Lips Away" in "Measure for Measure", IV, 1</:p>
<:p>- "O Mistress Mine" in "Twelfth Night", II, 3</:p>
<:p>- "Willow song" in "Othello", IV, 3</:p>
<:p>- "Where the Bee Sucks" in "The Tempest", VI, 1</:p>
<:p>- "How Should I Your True Love Know?" in "Hamlet" IV, 5</:p>
<:p>- "When Griping Griefs" in "Romeo and Juliet", IV, 5</:p>
<:p>- "Full Fathom Five" in "The Tempest", I, 2</:p>
<:p>- "Then They for Sudden Joy Did Weep" in "King Lear", I</:p>
<:p>- The Wind and the Rain: "When that I was a little tiny boy" in "Twelfth Night", V, 1</:p>
<:p>- "Caleno custure me" not sung but mentioned in "Henry V", IV, 4</:p>
<:p>- "Heart's Ease" in "Romeo and Juliet", IV, 5.102</:p>
<:p>Among the dances associated with Shakespeare's company is "Kemp's Jig" named after the actor Will Kemp.</:p>
<:p>The generations after Shakespeare saw many composers create or arrange music for his plays. Among the most notable were Thomas Morley, Henry Purcell, Matthew Locke, Thomas Arne, William Linley, Sir Henry Bishop, and Sir Arthur Sullivan.</:p>
<:p>Attempts at reconstructing and performing the "original" songs from the plays and related folk songs have been recorded by various musicians, from "Shakespeare Songs" by Alfred Deller (1967), to the recordings of Philip Pickett.</:p>
