<:h1>HTTP message body</:h1>
<:p>HTTP Message Body is the data bytes transmitted in an HTTP transaction message immediately following the headers if there are any (in the case of HTTP/0.9 no headers are transmitted).</:p>
<:p>The request/response message consists of the following:</:p>
<:p>- Request line, such as GET /logo.gif HTTP/1.1 or Status line, such as HTTP/1.1 200 OK,</:p>
<:p>- Headers</:p>
<:p>- An empty line</:p>
<:p>- Optional HTTP message body data</:p>
<:p>The request/status line and headers must all end with CRLF (that is, a carriage return followed by a line feed). The empty line must consist of only CRLF and no other whitespace.</:p>
<:p>The "optional HTTP message body data" is what this article defines.</:p>
<:p>This could be a response from the web server:</:p>
<:p>The message body (or content) in this example is the text "Hello world!".</:p>
